Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly become beautiful,
or have girls wearing glasses flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's glasses and putting them on like,
"Haha, got your glasses!" That's just way too cute! Also, boys with glasses! [...]
Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too![...]
It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet. [...]
We really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start selling them for HoloComi.
Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?!!!?

Yes Fubuki, yes I do
