# 42Pipex-Tester
Tester for the 42 cursus project: Pipex.
(Doesn't include bonus (yet))

It has a heavy focus on error handling.

The tester searches for the executable in the parent directory.
Just clone the repo **inside** your Pipex directory, move (cd) into the tester repo and run the tester with ```bash test_pipex.sh```.
1. Clone with: ```git@github.com:albertcaballero/42Pipex-Tester.git```
2. ```cd 42Pipex-Tester``` (or whatever name you called it)
3. ```bash test_pipex.sh```
